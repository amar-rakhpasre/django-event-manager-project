# Django Event Manager Project

## Project Overview

This project is a Django-based web application for managing events, including features for attendees, authentication, and event management. It is built using Django 3.2.25.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Vagrant**
- **VirtualBox**
- **Git**

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
The repository is cloned as part of the deployment script. No additional action is needed.

### 2. Configure Port Forwarding

Ensure your `Vagrantfile` includes the following configuration to forward port 8000 from the VM to the host:

```ruby
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8000, host: 8000
```

This configuration forwards port `8000` from the Vagrant VM to port `8000` on your host machine, allowing you to access the Django development server via your host's browser.

### 3. Start the Vagrant VM

```bash
vagrant up
```

### 4. SSH into the Vagrant VM

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

### 5. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd ~/ProjectShell_repo/django-event-manager-project/django-event-manager-project
```

### 6. Set Up the Virtual Environment

If you havenâ€™t set up a virtual environment yet:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 7. Install Project Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 8. Apply Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 9. Start the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

### 10. Access the Application

Visit `http://localhost:8000/` on your host machine's browser.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### 1. Port Already in Use

If you encounter an error indicating that the port is already in use:

```bash
Error: That port is already in use.
```

To resolve this, identify the process using the port and kill it:

```bash
sudo lsof -t -i tcp:8000 | xargs kill -9
```

### 2. Server Error on Host Machine

If you see a server error message like:

```plaintext
A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator.
```

Ensure that the server is running correctly and that the `DEBUG` mode is set to `True` in `Event_Management/settings.py` for development purposes:

```python
DEBUG = True
```

Restart the development server after making this change.

### 3. Python Syntax Errors

If you encounter a `SyntaxError` related to Python versions, ensure you are using Python 3.6+ and that the virtual environment is correctly activated.

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Vagrant Issues

If Vagrant is not functioning correctly, you can restart it:

```bash
vagrant halt
vagrant up
```

### 5. Connection Refused

If you get a `Connection refused` error when trying to curl or visit the site:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

Ensure that the server is running and that the firewall settings allow traffic on port 8000.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, run the deployment script:

```bash
./django-event-manager-project.sh
```

This script handles cloning the repository, setting up the environment, applying migrations, and starting the server.

## Conclusion

This README provides the necessary steps to get the Django Event Manager project up and running in a Vagrant environment. For further assistance, please refer to the official Django documentation or reach out to the project maintainers.
